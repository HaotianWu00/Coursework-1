                    region made of sweets and desserts in the galaxy. Meanwhile, back on earth, Bubbles enters the warp hole and goes to space, 
                    aiding the Angry Birds. The flock defeat the pig, which makes him spit out the eggsteroid in him, returning him back to a normal
                     pig. The birds later go to a red planet where they defeat the hordes of pigs.</span>
