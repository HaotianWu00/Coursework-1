                    <span>Angry birds is a 2009 casual puzzle video game developed by Rovio Entertainment. Inspired primarily by a sketch of 
                        stylized wingless birds, the game was first released for iOS and Maemo devices starting in December 2009.Since that time, 
                        over 12 million copies of the game have been purchased from the iOS App Store, which prompted the developer to design 
                        versions for other touchscreen-based smartphones, most notably Android, Symbian, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry 10 
                        devices. </span>

                <span>In Angry Birds, the player controls a flock of multi-colored birds that are attempting to retrieve their eggs, which have 
                    been stolen by a group of hungry green pigs. In each stage of the gameplay, enemy pigs are sheltered by structures made 
                    of various materials such as wood, glass, and stone resembling children's toy building blocks. The objective of the game 
                    is to eliminate all the pigs on the level. Using a slingshot, players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either 
                    striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures, causing the blocks to collapse and pop the pigs.
                     The player must set the angle and force of the bird's travel by pulling back on the slingshot (using intuitive 
                    touch-controls in the mobile versions). The launch process is quick and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a 
                    player simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the launch post from which the virtual slingshot will be released. </span>
